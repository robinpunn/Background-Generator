3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.

#### Completed Assignement
- TypeScript was used for this project
- Three colors were added to the gradient
- A copy button was added so users can copy the background
- Users can flip the direction of the gradient left or right
- Users can reset the color to the original gradient shown when the page loads
